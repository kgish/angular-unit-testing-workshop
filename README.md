# Angular Unit Testing Workshop

This is the company workshop I created about Angular Unit Testing adapted from the online [Unit Testing Angular Course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/unit-testing-angular) created by Joe Eames.

Angular provides out of the box set of tools to help us unit test our code, but all those tools and techniques need to 
be learned. 

In this course, Unit Testing in Angular, you will learn how to effectively unit test your Angular code. 

First, you will learn to write isolated tests to quickly and easily test services, pipes, and components.

Next, you will explore integration tests, used to test your components with their templates. 

Then, you will see how to deal with advanced topics like asynchronous code. 

Finally, and most importantly, you will know what it means to write effective, maintainable unit tests. 

When you are finished with this course, you will feel confident in your ability to write good unit tests for your 
Angular projects.
